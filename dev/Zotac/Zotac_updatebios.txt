Preamble:

This document details how to insert the Serial number into the BIOS on a Zotac machine

This procedure requires the use of "Mick's BIOS Boot USB Key" - MBUK for short.




Procedure:

	1. Verify that the Zotac to be updated is using American Megatrends (AMI) Bios.  Do this by going into BIOS.  

		*** DO NOT PROCEED IF THIS IS NOT AN AMI BIOS!! ***

	2. Insert MBUK into the Zotac and reset.

	3. While Zotac is starting press F8 to bring up the "Boot Device Menu"

	4. Select "SanDisk Cruzer" as boot device; this is MBUK

	5. Press enter when asked to boot USB.

	6. Select a Keyboard.  Either will do; they both work.

	7. Find the serial number of the device on its rear side.  It may look like "G####206####" and have a barcode above it.  Do not use the Ocean Serial number.

	8. At the dos prompt type "a.bat <serial no>" where <serial no> is the serial number for the Zotac.  Press Enter.

	9. This script will attempt to add the serial number to the BIOS and then will ask to be restarted.  Press any key.

	10. Again boot MBUK using the above procedure.

	11. At the dos prompt type "b.bat", which will display the serial number as recorded in BIOS.  Confirm that the serial number is correct.

	12. Record the Asset number and serial number and report these combinations to Michael or Shane.
