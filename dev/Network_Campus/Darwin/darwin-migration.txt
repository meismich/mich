Merge domain:

From Rob's Notes:
Have to use tool ADMT (Active Directory Migration Tool) [These steps KLOSTER specific]
1- Install on klo-dc1 (or whatever the primary is for this domain)
2- Get pw key from klo-dc20 (running pw service)
3- Run ADMT on klo-dc1 "as" KLOSTER_GROUP\administrator

Also
- Add domain administrators from src domain to admin local group
- Add domain administrators from dest domain to admin local group


Robs steps for migration [Translated into DARWIN specific]
1- a- Migrate Domain Global to Group
   b- Copy group members un-checked
   c- Fix membership of group checked

2- a- Migration Domain Local Group
   b- copy group members un-checked
   c- Fix membership of group checked

3- User account migration steps
   a- select users & target OU
   b- migrate p/w's
   c- "state = same as source" - migrate user SIDS
   d- user account -> use source domain administrator
   e- user options:
	i- update user rights (tick)
	ii- migrate associated user groups
	iii- Fix users group memberships (tick) checked

4- Computer accounts
   a- Change DNS server to qld-dc1?? first (apparently not needed??)
   b- Select all attributes
   c- user replace mode security translation (double tick??)

5- Run security translation wizard if any accounts are migrate "after" computer accounts.  also need to add "darwin\administrator" into local admin group on computer.

Additional notes:

When users reboot they must change the login domain to APEAGERS from DARWIN
