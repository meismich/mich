Topics in Detail

1. BRO Patching

The Brookvale site's patching at the core of the network is still in quite good working order.  There exists some complications as discussed here.

a. Inter-Rack Patching

The inter-rack patching, between the "Patch Rack" and the "Server Rack" is still difficult to visually trace.  

This table summarises the patching between the racks and their destinations.
