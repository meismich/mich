Process Steps:

Install 2003 Server R2

Install McAfee

Rum "dcpromo" and select "Additional DC" when asked (other options can be left as default)

Install DNS
	- Add/Remove Programs -> Windows Components -> Networking Services
	- Add DNS Forwarders (see "DNS Forwarders List.txt")


If this DC is to become PDC it will have to have FSMO roles transferred to it:

Before taking the PDC role

Set NTP Settings
	- Run "regedit"
	- HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Parameters
		[NtpServer] 	= ntp.adelaide.edu.au,0x1
		[Type]		= NTP
	- HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\config
		[AnnounceFlags] = 5
	- Restart "Windows Time" service via the "services" snap in

Take FSMO Roles
	- Run "ntdsutil"
	- Type "roles"
	- Type "connections"
	- Type "connect to server <your new DC>"
	- Type "q"
	- Type "transfer domain naming master"
	- Type "transfer infrastructure master"
	- Type "transfer PDC"
	- Type "transfer RID master"
	- Type "transfer schema master"
	- Type "q"
