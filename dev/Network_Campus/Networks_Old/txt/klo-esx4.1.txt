Each ESXi is configured in the identical manner.  This is necessary from a VMWare point of view so that VM's can be easily transported from machine to machine (vMotion).  From an identification point of view, it simply eases the setup and aesthetics of the system.

	Configuration Details (where {n} is the host number)
		Option		Value
		HostName	klo-esx{n}.ape.local
		IP Address	172.17.104.8{n}
		NetMask		255.255.252.0
		GW Address	172.17.104.254
		NameServers	172.17.104.234
				172.17.104.235
		root Pwd 	SecLvl 1
		
Using vSphere via the vCentre, the following options were configured on each of the hosts.  Again these options were identical across all ESX hosts.

	Storage:
		Identification		Device
		KLO_MX1_LOG		eui.2243000155441738:1
		KLO_MX1_OS		eui.22c60001554d4b1f:1
		KLO_VMFS		eui.22b4000155e3e4aa:1
		VM_ISO			eui.227e0001556f4edc:1

	Network:
		Switch Name	Port Groups		VLan		Adapters
		vSwitch0 	VM Kernel 		n/a		vmnic0 (primary)
				VM Network		0		vmnic2 (standby)
				Klosters DMZ		9
		vSwitch1	Klosters External	666		vmnic1 (primary)
									vmnic3 (standby)
Note: VM Kernel was configured for vMotion
Note: physical patching is required for Redundant pathing.
