Chassis Management:

The chassis management module allows access to control the featues of the MultiFlex.  This module has two network adapters, one internal (MultiFlex facing) and external (Network Facing).  Only the the external adapter is configurable and has been set to be accessible by the entire APEagers WAN.

	CMM Properties:
		HostName	klo-modular
		IP Address	172.17.104.5
		Netmask		255.255.252.0
		Gateway		172.17.107.254
		DNS		172.17.104.234
				172.17.104.235

Access to the CMM is granted to the following configured users.  

	Access:
		Name		Password
		issadmin 	SecLvl 1
		spearce		########
		msadmin		########
		klosters 	########

Note that the user "klosters" is not an administrator of the MultiFlex Chassis, but has the rights to administer the BSCMs and SCMs.


Blade Summary:

The MultiFlex has six (6) slots for the addition of blade server compute modules (BSCM).  Currently there are five (5) modules in the Kloster MultiFlex setup.

	Blades:
		Number		Host
		1		klo-esx1
		2		klo-esx2
		3		klo-esx3
		4		klo-ts1
		5		klo-vc
		6		(unused)



Storage:

The storage available to the MultiFlex is the internal drives which are attached to the two (2) storage control modules (SCMs).  The SCMs provide redundancy to the availability of these drives to the blades.  This model of the MultiFlex has fourteen (14) drive slots for HDDs, which are all populated (at this time) with 135GB drives.

The storage is configured into pools in the following way:

	Pool Name	Expected Usage			Discs	Size(GB)
	Pool1		Blade OSes			6	 815
	KloSAN		VM Storage			8	1088


The Pools are configured into Virtual Drive

	Drive Name	Expected Usage			RAID	Size	Host		Drive
	(Storage in Pool 1)
	klo-esx1	Host drive for esx1 		10	10GB	klo-esx1	0
	klo-esx2	Host drive for esx2 		10	10GB	klo-esx1	0
	klo-esx3	Host drive for esx3 		10	10GB	klo-esx1	0
	klo-vc		Host drive for Old VC 		10	50GB	   (not assigned)
	vm_ISO		Storage Pool for ISO's?? 	5	60GB	ALL ESX		2
	klo-vc_4.1	Host drive for New VC 		10	30GB	klo-vc		0
	klo ts1		Host drive for TS1 		10	30GB	klo-ts1		0
	klo ts1 pf	Data drive for TS1?? 		10	10GB	klo-ts1		1
	klo_mx1_os	Guest OS drive for MX1 		5	55GB	ALL ESX		3
	klo_mx1_log	Guest Log drive for MX1 	10	96GB	ALL ESX		4
	(Storage in KloSAN)
	klo esx		Storage Pool for VM Guests 	50	815GB	ALL ESX		1


Network:

The two switch modules (SWMs) provide the ability for redundant network pathing for each of the blades.  This is the intention of having both modules and hence they are essentially setup identically.  Note however the additional setup on Switch 1 to cater for the Juniper - Ext 4 is set to Vlan 9.

Switch 1 (Layer2 - VLAN)

	Properties:
		vlan id 9 "DMZ Network"
		vlan id 666 "External Network"
	Membership:
		vlan 9 tagged on
		ext2 and server n.1 (where n is the esx blade number)
		vlan 9 untagged on Ext 4
	Interface Settings:
		Ext 1 on vlan 666
		Server n.2 on Vlan 666 (where n is a esx blade number)
		Ext 4 ov vlan 9
		All other on Vlan 1

Switch 2 (Layer2 - VLAN)

	Properties:
		vlan id 9 "DMZ Network"
		vlan id 666 "External Network"
	Membership:
		vlan 9 tagged on
		ext2 and server n.1 (where n is the esx blade number)
	Interface Settings:
		Ext 1 on VLan 666
		Server n.2 on Vlan 666 (where n is a esx blade number)
		All other on Vlan 1
