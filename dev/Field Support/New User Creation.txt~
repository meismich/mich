Audience:

This documentation is for Field Support and Service Desk staff.  This documentation may be beneficial for remaining IT staff as the need arises.


Preamble:

This document applies to the creation of Active Directory user accounts.  This applies to users moving from one dealership to another, as users DO NOT retain the same account.

This document also details the creation of Office 365 user accounts, which is primarily used for the purpose of email.

The Active Directory setup gives a user the ability to log onto computers.  The Office 365 setup gives a user a mailbox for email purposes.  Each Office 365 account carries a charge to the dealership.

Some steps in this document apply when the user's role is easily ascertained and can be replicated from existing users.  Intuition may be required for some setups.

This document DOES NOT apply to the creation of ERA user accounts.

Topics in Detail

1. Required information

Before begining the creation process for a user, it should be obvious that some information is required before setup can be completed.  These are summarised below.

	a. User Details

Naturally, some of the most basic infomration that is required for a User setup are:
	- User Name (ie first and last name)
	- Dealership (whom user works for)
	- Location (where user is phyiscally located)
	- Phone Number

This information is essential in creating a standard, easily identifiable user account.

	b. Email requirements

Please note, an email account carries a cost to the dealership.  Although it is typical that a user has an associated email account, it may not be necessary in all cases.  Verify with the user's potential manager or financial controller.

Determine if the user is to have multiple email aliases.  This may be necessary if the dealership uses two or more domain names.

	c. Internet Access Level

As noted in the Internet Acces documentation, internet access can be granted by adding users to particular groups based on role or managerial strictness within the dealership.  Determine from the manager which level of access is appropriate for the user.  The following summarises the Levels of Access.

	d. File Share access

Throughout the dealerships of APEagers many file shares exist.  While attempts to standardise these shares has been made, many dealerships are still using haphazard file sharing techniques.  If required, it may be necessary to examine another user's setup to determine which shares are to be used by the new user.


2. Active Directory User Setup

These steps apply to a user which requires access to computers within the APEagers network.  They may not apply if the user only requires email.

Using the administrative tool, Active Directory Users and Computers, select the OU appropriate for the dealership the user is to be working in.  Within this OU, begin the creation of the new user.

Follow the steps of the wizard to create the new user.  Note that the exchange steps of the setup MUST BE SKIPPED for all setups.  [Attempts will be made to remove the exchange tasks from ADU&C to reduce the chance of creating exchange attributes.]

	a. User log on name: Naming conventions

During the setup wizard steps, the user's logon name must be given.  It has been the standard of APEagers IT in the past to use the following formula to generate a logon name:

	<username> = <first initial><lastname>
		(for example Joe Doofus Bloggs' username would be "jbloggs")

When the wizard returns the error, "The user logon name you have chosen is already in use in this enterprise.  Choose another logon name, and then try again.", it has been common practice to replace this formula with one of the following:

	<username> = <first initial><second initial><last name>
		or
	<username> = <last name><first initial>
		or
	<username> = <first name>.<last name>
		(for example Joe Doofus Bloggs' username could be "jdbloggs", "bloggsj" or "joe.bloggs")

Note capital letters DO NOT create unique names, and while not illegal, should not be used in login names.

	b. Password Creation

There are no rules for the creation of a password for a newly created account.  Rude or derogatory passwords are discouraged.  :)

It has been the Field Supports standard to create a password using the following formula:

	<password> = <day-of-week today><year today>
		(assuming today is Tuesday 20th of December 2011 password would be "tuesday2011")


	c. Adding Generic

After completing the user creation wizard, the user account can be editted and the generic information about the user can be added.

Double click or bring up the properties of the account to being this process.

Add in the collected information under the following tabs:
	
	- General
	- Address
	- Telephones
	- Organization

	c. Add Email address

If (and only if) this user is to be given an email account, on the general tab of the user properties, add the email address to the E-mail field.  By adding this property, when the Outlook client is configured, the email address will be able to be determined automatically by Outlook.

	d. Security Groups

Security groups control the access users have to many systems.  The following topics describe some of the common groups.

		i. Internet Access

According the the Internet Access documentation the following groups determine a user's level of access to the internet.

	Internet L0 - No Access
	Internet L1 - Manufacturer Only
	Internet L2 - Whitelist Only
	Internet L5 - Standard Access
	Internet L7 - + social Networking

Apply the approriate security group to the user.  Refer to the Internet Access documentation for further details.

		ii. Proxy Groups

By default, users within the APEagers network are given via group policy the "QLD-CSP" proxy server  to access the internet.  By adding a user to one of the following groups, they will be given its related proxy server

	Proxy - NSD-CSP
	Proxy - DWN-CSP

[Note at the time of writing this document DWN-CSP did not currently exist, but its existence was visible on the horizon]

		iii. Folder Redirection

Each dealership has a location where user's My Documents and Desktop are redirected from.  Typically the name of the folder redirection group for a dealership uses the following formula:

	<FR group> = _<d'ship acronym> Folder Redirection Group
		(for example Eagers Mazda has the folder redirection group "_EMZ Folder Redirection Group")

		iv. Shares Groups




3. Office 365 User Setup

	b. Details
	c. Additional details (Room Number)
	d. Licencing
