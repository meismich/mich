What can go wrong?
Lots of things can go wrong, but most faults won't damage your system.

The most critical moment is when writing back the registry files to NTFS.

The most common problem is that the computer was not cleanly shut down, and my disk won't write correctly back. (it says: read only filesystem). If so, boot into Windows Safe Mode (F8 before windows logo appears) and shut down from the login window. You may have to do that twice in a row.

Also, see the FAQ for help with other common problems.

For linux-knowledged people, you may do things manually if the scripts fail, you have shells on tty1-tty4 (ALT F1 - ALT F4).
