Audience:

Currently this document applies to all Services Staff including Field Support Officers, Infrastructure Staff, and System Administrators.  In the future, this document may encapsulate the naming conventions used by the Applications department.


Preamble:

All network devices should be given meaningful names appropriate to their location/dealership and function.  Following this document will allow machines and devices to be easily located and identified, greatly reducing the time required to perform such tasks.  When items are moved, they should be renamed to the new appropriate name.

Different device types have differing formulae for generating specific names.  Please refer to the appropriate formula for the device you are dealing with.  Fields in a formula will be enclosed by "<...>", which denote variable fields taken from one of the constant lists detailed below or by "[...]", which denotes variable fields which must be generated by the operator these will be defined in the definition of the formula.  The notation ":x" within a field indicates how many characters from the given field are to be used.
