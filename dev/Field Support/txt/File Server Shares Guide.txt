1. Overview of the Model

This model is designed to be a setup for all dealerships within APEagers.  Each dealership using this model will have a drive mapped to each user's computer, which all users can access to varying degrees.

The specific folders within this drive are intended for use by specific roles or departments within the dealership and the security groups configured for them will enforce this distinction.  

The end setup is intended to be simple enough that Service Desk staff can monitor and maintain the application
