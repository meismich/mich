Audience:

Currently this documentation is for Field Support Officers and their Supervisor.  In the future, I do not forsee as yet, other appropriate persons to whom this document may apply.  This documentation may be useful, in an informative manner, to General Managers, Accountants and Corporate staff for house keeping purposes.


Preamble:

This document applies to the timetable to be used for repetitively auditing IT equipment at dealerships.  Through this process, all assets will be accounted for and the Asset Database updated regularly, ensuring its validity and accuracy.  This must be done so that equipment charges, which are performed monthly, are correct.

This document DOES NOT include the method required to audit a site.  This document ONLY describes the plan for regular auditing of sites.


Dealerships and Estimated Number of IT Assets:

The following table describes for each Dealership (or Entity) the number of IT Assets at this dealership.  The number quoted should be treated as an estimate, but was accurate at the time of writing this document.
