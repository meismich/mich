Darwin PST Build



files in bris, all HVF and small BTD users

Missing files are large BTD users who are:




To create the large BTD users:
	All the 2GB PSTs which are the only copy of the "deleted"/"archived" emails exist in Darwin.
		-> File A (upto four for each user)
	Truncate all 2GB PSTs by x? to make file less than 2GB (around 40-70MB) 
		-> File B
	Scan this created PST with scanning tool
		-> File C
	

Issue with PST upload tool; duplicate entries for items already uploaded.
