Auto Reg application:
	- talks to IP address 203.25.42.232
	- can be configured for use with proxy

203.25.42.232
	- Responds regularly with:
		203.25.42.232 > 165.228.157.90: icmp: host 203.25.42.232 unreachable - admin prohibited

203.25.42.0/24 from aus-fw1 is routed back to EMP

203.25.42.232 from emp-rtr is routed to emp-pf by default
