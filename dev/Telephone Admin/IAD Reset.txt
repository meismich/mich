This is the method to factory reset an IAD.  This will wipe all settings and the device will need to reconnect the the Telstra network before it can regain settings.

Applies to 8-port IAD devices (not sure about 2-port)

1. Attach Analogue phone to port 1 of IAD (Old Telstra White phone is suitable)

2. Pick up the handset attached to your SPA device. (You may or may not hear the dialtone.) 

3. Dial ****73738# (You should be asked to confirm.)

4. Dial 1# to confirm. 

5. Hang up.
