Creating Agent Files:
This can be done "per domain" on the network.  Go to "system Tree" and "System Tree Actions".  Select "new Systems" and change radio selection to "Create and Download agent installation package".  Add the correct domain credentials and press OK.  Finally download the file on the following page and name appropriately.
