Plan so far:

Tim Walters has initially setup a backup system BNE-BK1 which is a 2008 R2 64bit server running on SAN style hardware.

This system has 14 drives installed:
	2x SSD 32GB mirrored
	12x 15k 300GB in R10

Currently lives in "Rack 3" at EMP DC.  Has a remote management interface, configured with IP 10.1.1.130.  To be changed to something less production and more core.... suggesting 10.1.0.50.

Has vRanger4 installed as a trial.  Has Symantec Backup Exec installed as trial.  Both out of date at the time of this document.  This software to be uninstalled.

Current model will have the following software installed:
	vRanger 4		\
	vFoglight		 >-- vRanger Essentials??
	vFoglight Storage	/
	Symantec Backup Exec 2010

Will also need new SAS controller installed in machine.  Will require machine to be removed from rack and hardware installed.

New tape drive has been purchased and is ready to be installed at data centre alongside the installed backup server.

Tim's doco will explain the method for installing required software.
