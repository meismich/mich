purpose:
To explain the numerous different steps I've taken to repair the update facility on the Ford IDS machines.

Uninstalled the IDS program, reinstalled version 68.  Tried running the Software Manager to see if updates were available.  SM quoted that there wasn't - even though the program had been at version 68.02 prior to the uninstall.  

Then deleted the .ini files in the directory "C:\documents and settings\mfvsvci\Application Data\FLEXnet\Connect\Database\." and also the registry entry "HKCU\Software\InstallShield\DownloadManager\Files\68.02"

Re-ran SM and voila there was an update 68.11 available.  Ran update.  System now functional but needs credentials due to the clean install.
