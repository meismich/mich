Townsville Outage 2010-10-22
-----------------------------------------

Power outage at 8.05am
Cause - Air Conditioner installer tripped power.
Power restored by 8.30am (wheh I checked network)
Approached by Leah at 9.20am 
Toby experiencing issues with a beeping UPS
Rang Toby
Toby found beeping coming from Server
Shutdown Server - Beeping Stopped
Had Toby restart server
20 sec later beeping started again
Using this info I called Rob at Ocean
Rob suggested that the Raid may have dropped a disk
Beeps would be a warning for this
Rob suggested to install Raid Web Console
Downloaded RWC from Intel (45MB - approx 3 min)
Got a coffee
Started copying to ETOFS (which was on)
Estimated time to copy was 17min
Prepared to go to Toowong
At around 30s to go I lost all contact with ETOFS
I rang the main ETO phone number - no answer
I rang Toby's number - no answer
I rang Tony's number - no answer
I gave up and went to Toowong
While driving Toowong I got a call from Tony??
I told him I was in the car driving to Toowong
I told him I could not help him at that time
He told me to drive safely
I arrived at Toowong at approximately 10.45am
I gained access to a computer at Toowong, ETOFS still down
Assumedly Toby was sick of the noise and wanted it shut down
.... Not my call, that was his
Apparently there was a helpdesk call raised at 10.40am
Call stated two other machines inoperable
Have only just read this call at 1.45pm
Have installed network switches and cabling for Toowong
Have helped move computers into showroom for storage
Have relocated Phonemastery systems
Have disconnected old switch from network
This has taken me up until this time to complete
Yes, I have had lunch
