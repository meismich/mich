(Note)
*.apeagers.com.au is set so that laptops, which leave our network and use Wireless modems (for offsite sales etc), cannot access the internet, but can access sites such as citrix.apeagers.com.au and owa.apeagers.com.au .  This is an attempt to limit the usage of these wireless modems.  We have work arounds for managers who do more than simple off site work.
