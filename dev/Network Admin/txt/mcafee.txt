Configuring Clients:

Clients should have the latest Version of McAfee installed.  For us this is 8.7i.

The installation for this program is located at:

	\\nas\nas\mcafee\Mcafee Enterprise 8.7i

Once the installation is completed, the client needs to be attached to an ePO repository to download the latest DATs or Engines.  This is done by a Packages specifically built for a location.  There are a number of preconfigured Package installers already created.  Batch files have been created for the easy installation of these.  They are:

	APEagers Default:	\\nas\nas\mcafee\installagent.cmd
	Darwin Repository:	\\nas\nas\mcafee\DWN - installagent.cmd
	Klosters Repository:	\\nas\nas\mcafee\KLO - installagent.cmd

(Later in this document, a demonstration of how to build these installations is given)

Build Agent Installation Package:

Using the "Menu v" button, navigate to "Systems -> System Tree"

Under the "How to add systems" options, select "Create and download agent installation package".
Enter the Domain credentials as requested. 
4 When prompted, select the location for downloading and saving the installation package.
5 Distribute the custom installation package file as needed.
